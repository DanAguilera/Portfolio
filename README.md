## This is my online portfolio for future projects 

I wanted to build a portfolio to store my future projects in and also one in which i woudnt have to immediately do work on it throughout the bootcamp, I wanted it accesible and interactive to the best of my abilities. Considering this website is probably going to be the one in which I store all my projects in the future when I can be considered a seasoned developer, I went all in. 

A couple of things in which I took away from this project is learning not only how to make a website interactive but to really hone in on my CSS skills, I had a ton of fun learning new things in CSS like the 'transform' button and 'transition' button to name a few. It really helped make my webstie pop and add the extra touch needed.
